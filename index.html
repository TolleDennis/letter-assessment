    <h1> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Eileen,<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as
        part<br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

        <h3>Starting dates</h3>

        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
        you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>

        You can find more information about important university dates on our website.


        <h2> Subjects of study</h2><br>

        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
        fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        <br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        <br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                <br>
                audience
                size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.


        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your<br>
        question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>

        Polynesian chicken dance<br>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in
        a<br>
        circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
        imperceptibly<br>
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern<br>
        styles such as Twerking.<br>
        Arctic robot dance<br>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered
        a<br>
        new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
        Alaska<br>
        and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>
        cold.

        For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.
